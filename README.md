# Tic-Tac-Toe_game
Built a tic-tac-toe game using HTML, CSS and JS.
Focusing more on implementing the java script fundamentals, you can play the X/O game conviniently. 
Includes a "Reset Game" button allowing you to reset the game whenever required.
Also at the end of the game it displays the winner and with the "New Game" button you can start over with the game.
